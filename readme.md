Code Snippets
=============

Simple code snippet app thrown together on a lazy Sunday evening.
Runs on top of MongoDB because I felt like trying something new.  Also, is some what (feebly) JS driven - trying to expand my knowledge a bit.

Has a small REST API for interacting with the snippets.

Prerequisites 
=============
You'll need:
* Apache2 with mod_rewrite installed and enabled
* Php 5.1+ (required by Tonic) ((Built and tested on php 5.3.6))
* MongoDB (Built and tested with 2.0.5)
